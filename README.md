# Pre-Requisite and Warnings

This is a personnal project. It uses your local storage to store your previous parameters (Choosen theme and choosen timer only)

A V2 is in preparation with these changes :

- Completely remade with ReactJS
- Secret mode
- Warning and prompt for local storage use
- Choice between FR and UK languages (At the moment, only available in french, so accent can be a problem for non french layout)

No needs for dependencies

## Running it locally

Just launch index.html in your favorite browser.
